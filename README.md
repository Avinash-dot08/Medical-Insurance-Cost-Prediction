# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
In this project, I explored a dataset containing health-related information for individuals (age, BMI, smoking status, number of dependents, etc.) to predict insurance costs using various machine learning techniques. The goal was to identify key drivers behind these costs and develop a robust, scalable prediction model.
